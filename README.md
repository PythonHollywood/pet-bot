# Pet Bot - A Tamagotchi-style Twitter Bot

The aim of this project is to create a Twitter bot that behaves similar to the
[Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) toy popular in the 1990's.
We will implement typical actions and responses from the Tamagotchi.

The pet runs on a Twitter account. Pet actions are expressed in tweets and profile picture changes. Users interact with the pet through mentions. This allows for communal, public interactions with the pet.
